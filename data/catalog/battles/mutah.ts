/**
 * The module was created carrying a contradiction and this chapter settles it.
 *
 * The retired seed named the battle غزوة مؤتة and recorded the Prophet as a
 * participant, which the vocabulary in src/lib/catalog/types.ts cannot hold at
 * once: a غزوة is one he went out for. Chapter ten says what he did — بعث إلى
 * مؤتة ... وأمر على الناس زيد بن حارثة — so he sent and did not go, the
 * engagement is a سرية, and the seed's participation was wrong rather than
 * merely uncited.
 *
 * It is therefore dropped, not moved to the legacy marker. The marker is for a
 * value in use whose evidence is owed; this one has evidence against it.
 *
 * Zayd's command comes with the succession the Prophet set at the same moment,
 * Ja'far then Ibn Rawahah. Neither of those two is recorded here: the model
 * holds who was at a battle, not the order in which command would pass.

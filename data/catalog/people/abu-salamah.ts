 * Year four opens with the سرية he led to قطن and closes with his death from
 * the Uhud wound that reopened, so chapter six is where he stops being a name
 * in the emigration rosters. His mother, carried here on the marker when his
 * seed entry was retired, is named in the same sentence that gives his nasab.
 *
 * `companion` stays on the marker: the chapter never calls him one, and the
 * milk-brotherhood was already cited from chapter one.
